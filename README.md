# NoCrumbs
> Git blame for the AI era. See every decision Claude Code made in your codebase and why.

A native Mac menu bar app that links every file change Claude Code makes back to the prompt that caused it — in real time, fully local, zero config after setup.

## Quick Start

### 1. Build & launch the app

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geneyoo/nocrumbs.git && cd nocrumbs
xcodebuild -project NoCrumbs.xcodeproj -scheme NoCrumbs -configuration Release -sdk macosx -derivedDataPath build build CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO
open build/Build/Products/Release/NoCrumbs.app
```

NoCrumbs lives in the menu bar. Press **⌘⇧N** to toggle the window.

### 2. Install the CLI

```bash
swift build -c release --package-path CLI/
cp CLI/.build/release/nocrumbs /usr/local/bin/
```

### 3. Configure Claude Code hooks

```bash
nocrumbs install
```

This adds hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json` so Claude Code automatically sends prompt and file change events to NoCrumbs. Run it once — works across all projects.

### 4. Use Claude Code normally

That's it. Open any project with Claude Code and prompts + file changes will appear in NoCrumbs automatically. No permissions required — no Accessibility, no Full Disk Access, no API keys, no accounts.

### Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Xcode 15+ (to build)
- Claude Code CLI

## Project Plan

## Vision

A native Mac menu bar app that gives engineers a beautiful, always-on view of everything Claude Code (or Codex CLI) does to their codebase — automatically, with zero changes to workflow. Built for IDE-less AI coding workflows where the terminal + Claude Code is the full stack.

**Core insight:** When AI writes code, the "author" is a prompt. Traditional diff tools show *what* changed. NoCrumbs shows *what* changed and *why* — linking every file change back to the prompt that caused it.

**Core experience:** A live companion window alongside your terminal. You type a prompt, Claude makes changes across 10+ files, and NoCrumbs instantly shows you what changed — organized by the prompt you just typed, not buried in a `git diff` wall. Like Kaleidoscope meets git blame, organized by AI prompts instead of commits.

---

## Problem Statement

Claude Code with subagents, plan mode, todos, and parallel agents generates massive activity logs. Engineers working IDE-less have no good way to:
- Review what the AI actually changed
- Understand the intent behind each change
- Navigate a session's history prompt by prompt
- Draft PR descriptions from session context

Cursor and VS Code have inline ephemeral diffs — gone when the session closes, IDE-bound, no persistent history. NoCrumbs is the real-time companion that's always there — updating live as Claude works, persistent across sessions, and organized by intent.

---

## What NoCrumbs Is Not

- Not an inline editor diff (that's Cursor's job — diffs injected into your source files)
- Not a code review bot
- Not another thing that needs an API key
- Not a cloud service
- Not an IDE plugin

---

## Core Features (v1)

### 1. Zero-friction capture
Claude Code triggers NoCrumbs via dual hooks (`UserPromptSubmit` + `PostToolUse`) — deterministic, not CLAUDE.md (which gets ignored). No commands, no extra steps. Install once, works forever.

### 2. Prompt → file change linkage
Every file change is linked to the prompt that caused it via session ID. Like git blame but for AI decisions. Subagent noise is filtered out — only top-level user prompts are captured.

### 3. Collapsible commit/prompt timeline
```
▼ Commit 2  — "refactor auth to async/await"        [3 files]
    ▼ Prompt 3 — "clean up error handling"           [auth.swift]
    ▼ Prompt 2 — "remove completion handlers"        [auth.swift, user.swift]
    ▶ Prompt 1 — "convert fetchUser to async"        [user.swift]

▶ Commit 1  — "add login flow"                       [5 files]
```
Chevron fold/expand per commit. Click a prompt → loads that diff in the right pane.

### 4. Two-pane diff viewer
Clean side-by-side diff with syntax highlighting. Before on left, after on right. Prompt header above showing intent.

### 5. Git + Mercurial support
Detects VCS automatically (`.git` vs `.hg`). Same unified diff format, just different commands. ~1 day of extra work.

### 6. Commit message annotation
Automatically appends prompt history to commit messages — below a `---` separator so it never interferes with existing templates (Phabricator, Conventional Commits, Jira prefixes, etc).

**Single prompt — collapsed one-liner:**
```
refactor: convert auth to async/await
---
🍞 refactor auth to async/await · 4 files · abc12345
```

**Multiple prompts — expanded list:**
```
refactor: convert auth to async/await
---
🍞 3 prompts · 8 files · abc12345

1. refactor auth to async/await (3 files)
2. add error handling to the new async methods (3 files)
3. update tests for new async patterns (2 files)
```

- Appends to the end, after whatever template the user/team already has
- `---` horizontal rule is a universal separator — Phabricator, GitHub, hg all ignore it
- `git log --oneline` / `hg log -T '{desc|firstline}'` never sees it
- Up to 10 prompts shown, rest collapsed (`+ N more`)
- Noise prompts filtered (e.g. "commit", "push", "ok")
- Chronological order (oldest first) so intent-setting prompts surface to top
- Session ID (8-char prefix) is the lookup key back into NoCrumbs
- Can be disabled via settings
- Fully customizable via `nocrumbs template` (see below)

### 7. Customizable annotation templates
Create custom commit annotation formats via CLI — designed for agents to configure per-project:

```bash
nocrumbs template add --name "minimal" --body '---\n{{summary_line}}'
nocrumbs template set --name "minimal"
nocrumbs template preview   # verify with real data
nocrumbs template list      # see all templates
nocrumbs template remove --name "minimal"
```

Available placeholders: `{{prompt_count}}`, `{{total_files}}`, `{{session_id}}`, `{{summary_line}}`, and `{{#prompts}}...{{/prompts}}` loop with `{{index}}`, `{{text}}`, `{{file_count}}`.

Templates are also manageable in the Settings UI (tap to activate, right-click to delete).

### 8. Fully local, no cloud
All data stays on device. No API keys, no accounts, no telemetry. NoCrumbs never makes network calls. Uses the user's own Claude Code subscription for any AI features.

---

## v2 Features (Backlog)

### PR Description Draft
At end of session, auto-draft PR description + test plan from prompt history. User edits, doesn't write. Stack-aware — each commit in a Mercurial stack or git stack gets its own description.

Instead of calling an API, NoCrumbs generates a structured prompt and invokes `claude` CLI as a subprocess using the user's own subscription. Zero API costs.

```bash
# NoCrumbs generates and runs:
claude "Generate a PR description from these commits and prompts: ..."
```

### Template System (v1 shipped in M4)
Commit annotation templates shipped in M4. v2: PR description templates with team-shared presets and per-repo defaults.

### Theme Support
Drop-in VS Code / TextMate `.tmTheme` / `.json` theme files. Drag onto preferences window to install. Ships with Tokyo Night, Dracula, Catppuccin, Nord defaults. Future: themes gallery at nocrumbs.app/themes.

### Semantic Diff (Stretch)
Instead of line-level diff, understand code structure. "Function moved, unchanged" instead of 40 red/green lines. Uses `difftastic` under the hood.

## Architecture

> For full technical details (schema, code examples, data flow): see `docs/architecture.md`

```
Claude Code hooks (dual-hook design)
    ↓ UserPromptSubmit              ↓ PostToolUse (Write|Edit)
nocrumbs capture-prompt         nocrumbs capture-change
    ↓ stdin JSON → socket           ↓ stdin JSON → socket
    └──────────┬────────────────────┘
               ↓ Unix domain socket
    NoCrumbs.app SocketServer (POSIX, actor)
               ↓
    SQLite (raw C API, WAL mode)  +  git/hg CLI (diffs on demand)
               ↓
    Timeline UI → Diff Viewer → PR Draft
```

### Key architectural decisions

**Dual-hook design.** `UserPromptSubmit` captures the prompt text + session ID. `PostToolUse` (matcher: Write|Edit) captures file changes + session ID. Session ID links them together.

**CLI is fire-and-forget.** Reads stdin JSON, writes to socket, exits immediately. If app isn't running, drops payload silently. Always exits 0 — never blocks Claude Code.

**Don't store diffs.** Git already stores them permanently. NoCrumbs stores only the prompt↔file change mapping. Derive diffs on demand via `git diff`. Entire DB stays under 1MB for years of use.

**Separate fileChanges table.** A single prompt can touch 100+ files. Storing file paths in a normalized table (not a JSON array) enables indexed queries like "all prompts that touched this file."

**Raw SQLite over ORMs.** Bulk insert 100 file paths in a single transaction: ~1ms. No GRDB/SwiftData overhead. System library, zero dependencies.

**Capture at prompt boundary, not subagent boundary.** Subagent activity, plan mode steps, todo checkboxes — all discarded. Only top-level user prompts + resulting file changes are stored.

**No TTL needed.** Git has no TTL on local commits. Normal commits on a branch live forever locally. NoCrumbs just stores the metadata sidecar.

**Handle dangling commits gracefully.** If user rebases or force-pushes, commit hash changes. Check if hash resolves before rendering — show "commit no longer exists" if not.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Mac App | SwiftUI + AppKit hybrid | SwiftUI for chrome, AppKit where SwiftUI can't do it |
| App Lifecycle | `NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor` | Owns SocketServer + Database lifecycle |
| Menu Bar | `MenuBarExtra` | Native Mac pattern |
| Diff View | `NSTextView` (TextKit 1) via `NSViewRepresentable` | Battle-tested, no TextKit 2 scrolling bugs |
| Syntax Highlighting | Regex-based token highlighter (18 languages) | Lightweight, Kaleidoscope-style, no TreeSitter dependency |
| Timeline | SwiftUI `List` + `DisclosureGroup` | Native, lazy, performant |
| Gutter/connector | SwiftUI `Canvas` | GPU-accelerated custom drawing |
| Scroll sync | `NSScrollView` delegate bridged to SwiftUI | Only AppKit can do this reliably |
| Local DB | Raw SQLite3 C API (WAL mode) | Bulk performance, zero dependencies, system library |
| IPC | Unix domain socket (POSIX) | Sub-millisecond, no overhead |
| CLI | Swift Package Manager standalone binary | Fast startup, zero dependencies |
| VCS | `git`/`hg` CLI subprocess via `Process` | Don't reinvent, just call them |
| Updates | Sparkle framework | Standard for non-App Store Mac apps |
| Observation | `@Observable` (Swift 5.9+) | Modern pattern, not ObservableObject |

### SwiftUI performance rules
- Make `DiffLine` and `DiffHunk` models `Equatable` to skip unnecessary redraws
- Stable IDs on all `ForEach` / `List` items
- `LazyVStack` for timeline — never eager load all commits
- Scope ViewModels tightly, avoid large global environment objects
- Parse and prepare diff data off main thread, publish to UI via `@MainActor`

### NSTextView for diff panes
Custom `NSViewRepresentable` wrapping `NSTextView` (TextKit 1). Line background colors (green/red) applied as `NSAttributedString` attributes. Regex-based syntax highlighting overlays foreground colors on top — comments, strings, keywords, types, numbers. Supports 18 languages (Swift, Python, JS/TS, Go, Rust, C/C++, Java, Ruby, JSON, YAML, SQL, HTML, CSS, Shell, Markdown, TOML). Custom line number gutter drawn via `NSTextView.draw(_:)` override.

---

## Diffing Strategy

**v1:** Vanilla `git diff` / `hg diff`. Unified diff format. Simple, universal, works everywhere.

**v1.5:** Word-level diff (`git diff --word-diff`) for inline character highlighting within changed lines. Low effort, high polish.

**v2 backlog:** Semantic diff via `difftastic` for structure-aware comparison.

No need to implement diff algorithms in Swift — just parse the unified diff output from the VCS CLI. Swift's built-in `CollectionDifference` (Myers algorithm) is available if needed for UI-level diffing.

---

## Data Model

```swift
struct Session: Identifiable, Codable, Equatable, Sendable {
    let id: String              // Claude Code session_id
    let projectPath: String
    let startedAt: Date
    var lastActivityAt: Date
}

struct PromptEvent: Identifiable, Codable, Equatable, Sendable {
    let id: UUID
    let sessionID: String
    let projectPath: String
    let promptText: String?     // nil for orphaned file changes
    let timestamp: Date
    let vcs: VCSType?
    let baseCommitHash: String? // HEAD at prompt time — diff baseline
}

struct FileChange: Identifiable, Codable, Equatable, Sendable {
    let id: UUID
    let eventID: UUID           // FK → PromptEvent
    let filePath: String
    let toolName: String        // "Write" or "Edit"
    let timestamp: Date
}

enum VCSType: String, Codable, Sendable {
    case git
    case mercurial
}

// Diffs NOT stored — derived on demand:
// git diff {hash}~1 {hash}
// hg diff -c {rev}
```

### Storage layout
```
~/Library/Application Support/NoCrumbs/
├── nocrumbs.sqlite    ← sessions + prompt events + file changes
└── nocrumbs.sock      ← Unix domain socket (while app running)
```

No diff blobs, no file snapshots. Lean sidecar only.

---

## Claude Code Hook Setup

Dual-hook design. Hooks receive data via **stdin as JSON** (not environment variables).

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json (installed by `nocrumbs install`)
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "nocrumbs capture-prompt"
        }]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "nocrumbs capture-change"
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Stdin formats:**

```json
// UserPromptSubmit → nocrumbs capture-prompt
{"session_id": "abc123", "prompt": "refactor auth to async/await", "cwd": "/path/to/project"}

// PostToolUse → nocrumbs capture-change
{"session_id": "abc123", "tool_name": "Write", "tool_input": {"file_path": "/path/file.swift"}, "cwd": "/path/to/project"}
```

`nocrumbs install` command sets this up automatically, merging with existing settings. Engineer runs one command, never thinks about it again.

---

## Menu Bar App Behavior

```xml
<!-- Info.plist -->
<key>LSUIElement</key>
<true/>
```

Invisible to `⌘Tab` and Spotlight by default. When main window opens, dynamically switch to `.regular` activation policy so it appears in `⌘Tab`. Switch back to `.accessory` when window closes.

```swift
// Window opens
NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.regular)

// Window closes
NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)
```

Global hotkey (e.g. `⌘⇧N`) to show/hide from anywhere. Menu bar icon shows subtle badge when new activity captured while window is hidden.

---

## Distribution

**Not on Mac App Store.** App Store sandbox would block filesystem access, socket IPC, and subprocess execution. All critical for NoCrumbs.

**Requirements:**
- Apple Developer account ($99/yr) — for code signing + notarization
- Notarization via `notarytool` — prevents Gatekeeper warning
- Sparkle framework — in-app auto-updates

**Distribution stack:**
- GitHub releases for binary + DMG
- Landing page at nocrumbs.app
- Sparkle update feed hosted on nocrumbs.app

---

## Monetization

**Launch strategy: Free, closed source**

- Free to start — maximize distribution, build reputation, validate the tool
- Closed source — simpler, no forking risk
- No API costs (fully local architecture)
- Decide later: pivot to paid or open source based on traction

**If pivoting to paid:**
- $29 one-time via LemonSqueezy (handles global VAT as merchant of record)
- LemonSqueezy → Mercury bank account (business) or personal bank
- ~$24-25 net per sale after fees
- 1,000 sales = ~$24,000

**If pivoting to open source:**
- MIT license everything
- GitHub Sponsors + optional paid PR drafting tier
- Community contributions on themes, VCS support, integrations

**Warning:** Free → paid is hard (user backlash). Free → open source is easy. Decide before you have 10k users.

**Business setup (when ready):**
- Wyoming single-member LLC (~$100 to file, $60/yr)
- Northwest Registered Agent (~$39/yr)
- EIN from IRS.gov (free, instant)
- Mercury business bank account (free, no minimums)

## Competitive Landscape

| Feature | Cursor | VS Code + Claude Code ext | NoCrumbs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Real-time diff as AI works | ✅ (inline) | ✅ (inline) | ✅ (companion window) |
| Prompt-organized diffs | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Persistent diff history | ❌ (vanishes on accept) | ❌ | ✅ |
| IDE-less / terminal workflow | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Commit/stack timeline | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Mercurial support | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| PR description from session | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Native Mac UX | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

Cursor shows you diffs inline and they vanish when you accept. NoCrumbs is the persistent, prompt-organized companion — live while you work, accumulated across sessions, IDE-independent.

## Design Principles

**Fire and forget.** The hook must never slow Claude Code. CLI exits in <50ms. Silent failure if app isn't running. Always exit 0.

**Local first, always.** No network calls, no accounts, no telemetry. Ever. This is a trust advantage.

**Capture intent, not noise.** Top-level prompts only. Subagents, plan steps, todos — all discarded. The commit message is the best condenser.

**Derive, don't duplicate.** Git already stores diffs. Store only what git doesn't have: the prompt↔file change link.

**Scale for real workloads.** A single prompt can generate 100+ file changes. Normalized tables with indexes, not JSON arrays.

**Ship M4 before M5.** The diff viewer with prompt annotation is the product. PR drafting is a bonus. Don't let scope creep delay launch.

**Use real hooks from day one.** Wire up Claude Code hooks in your own workflow from M1. Don't mock data.

---

## One-liner
*"A live companion for IDE-less AI coding. See every change Claude Code makes, organized by the prompt that caused it — as it happens."*

## Elevator pitch
*"Git blame for the AI era. NoCrumbs sits alongside your terminal and shows you what Claude Code changed and why — in real time, organized by prompt, persistent across sessions. Kaleidoscope meets git blame, built for engineers who've left the IDE."*

---

## Domain + Branding
- **Name:** NoCrumbs
- **Domain:** nocrumbs.app ($12.98/yr on Namecheap/Porkbun)
- **CLI tool name:** `nocrumbs`
- **Logo direction:** clean surface, broom, or cookie with clean bite
- **Tone:** built by an engineer, for engineers. No fluff.
